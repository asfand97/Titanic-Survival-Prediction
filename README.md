## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves the following steps:

- Loading and exploring the Titanic training and testing datasets.
- Performing data visualization and statistical analysis.
- Handling missing values in the dataset.
- Label encoding categorical variables.
- Feature selection and splitting the dataset into the feature matrix and target variable.
- Developing and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Preprocessing the testing dataset for making predictions.
- Making predictions and updating the submission file.

## Data Exploration

The initial exploration involves loading the training and testing datasets, displaying basic information about the data, and performing statistical analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

This section covers handling missing values, filling in missing values using mean and mode techniques, and label encoding categorical variables.

## Feature Selection

Removing unnecessary columns (Cabin, Ticket, Name) for feature selection.

## Model Development and Evaluation

Developing machine learning models and evaluating their performance using accuracy and cross-validation scores.

## Preprocessing Testing Data

Preprocessing the testing dataset for making predictions.

## Prediction

Making predictions using the trained machine learning model.

## Submission

Updating the submission file with the predicted values.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project based on your Titanic survival prediction needs!
